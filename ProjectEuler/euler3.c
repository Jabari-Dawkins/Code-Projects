 1) Pick any a with 1 < a < N-1.
 2) Find the greatest common divisor d of a and N. 
    If d > 1, then N is composite, and d is a factor.  
    If d = 1, then compute the remainder of a^(N-1) when divided by N.
      If this is not 1, then N is composite.
      If this is 1, you can't tell if N is prime or not. */
